## Creat the data frame
```{r}
diet <- data.frame(row.names = c("subject_1","subject_2","subject_3","subject_4","subject_5"),
                   before_diet = c(104,95,87,77,102),
                   after_diet = c(96,91,81,75,118))
diet
str(diet)
typeof(diet[,1])
```

## Creat the BUBBLE_DIET list
```{r}
BUBBLE_DIET <- list(
  
  bubble_tea = data.frame(
    subject = rep(row.names(diet),2),
    weight = c(diet[,1],diet[,2]),
    time = as.factor(c(rep("before_diet",5),rep("after_diet",5)))),
  
  WEIGHT_LOSS = list(
    subjects = row.names(diet),
    weight_loss = (diet[,2]-diet[,1])/diet[,1],
    table = data.frame(subject = row.names(diet), 
                       weight_loss = (diet[,2]-diet[,1])/diet[,1])),
  
  message = "It's great!.")

BUBBLE_DIET
```

## Check the elements of BUBBLE_DIET
```{r}
str(BUBBLE_DIET)
```
